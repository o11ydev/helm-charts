# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged
# into versioned archives to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart
# developer. They're included as a dependency of application charts to
# inject those utilities and functions into the rendering  pipeline.
# Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each
# time you make changes to the chart and its templates, including the app
# version. Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning.
version: v0.1.2

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version
# number should be incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# Versions are not expected to follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect
# the version the application is using. It is recommended to use it with quotes.
